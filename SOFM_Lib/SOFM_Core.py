Description: This represents the core code for building and
training SOFM nets. The code was made into a module initially
so that it would be easier to incorporate it as an actual
library, should the need or desire ever arise.

import numpy as np




class SOFMGrid:

    def __init__(self):
        self.width = 1
        self.height = 1
